##### OVERVIEW: 
IPL data analysis project involves analysing data related to the Indian Premier League (IPL). The project aims to derive insights, trends, and patterns from various IPL datasets, which can include player and teams’ statistics, and performance optimization in the IPL like identify player weaknesses, relationship between toss winning – match winning and the role of playgrounds in winning matches and more.
##### ABOUT IPL: 
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional T20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India.

##### DATA DESCRIPTION:
Data is taken from Kaggle which has two datasets including all the matches from 2008 to 2020. 
The two datasets are:
- IPL ball by ball data for every match played
- Matches - data for all matches played
##### TOOLS & LIBRARY:
- Jupyter Notebook: The Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform. The notebook combines live code, equations, narrative text, visualizations
- Python: Python is a very popular programming language
- NumPy: NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- Pandas: pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series
- Seaborn: Seaborn is an amazing visualization library for statistical graphics plotting in Python. It provides beautiful default styles and colour palettes to make statistical plots more attractive. It is built on top matplotlib library and is also closely integrated with the data structures from pandas.
Seaborn aims to make visualization the central part of exploring and understanding data.
- Mat plot: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy
